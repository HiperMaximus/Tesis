	abstract = {Objective:
Digital pathology is today a widely used technology, and the digitalization of microscopic slides into whole slide images ({WSIs}) allows the use of machine learning algorithms as a tool in the diagnostic process. In recent years, “deep learning” algorithms for image analysis have been applied to digital pathology with great success. The training of these algorithms requires a large volume of high-quality images and image annotations. These large image collections are a potent source of information, and to use and share the information, standardization of the content through a consistent terminology is essential. The aim of this project was to develop a pilot dataset of exhaustive annotated {WSI} of normal and abnormal human tissue and link the annotations to appropriate ontological information.

Materials and Methods:
Several biomedical ontologies and controlled vocabularies were investigated with the aim of selecting the most suitable ontology for this project. The selection criteria required an ontology that covered anatomical locations, histological subcompartments, histopathologic diagnoses, histopathologic terms, and generic terms such as normal, abnormal, and artifact. {WSIs} of normal and abnormal tissue from 50 colon resections and 69 skin excisions, diagnosed 2015-2016 at the Department of Clinical Pathology in Linköping, were randomly collected. These images were manually and exhaustively annotated at the level of major subcompartments, including normal or abnormal findings and artifacts.

Results:
Systemized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms ({SNOMED} {CT}) was chosen, and the annotations were linked to its codes and terms. Two hundred {WSI} were collected and annotated, resulting in 17,497 annotations, covering a total area of 302.19 cm2, equivalent to 107,7 gigapixels. Ninety-five unique {SNOMED} {CT} codes were used. The time taken to annotate a {WSI} varied from 45 s to over 360 min, a total time of approximately 360 h.

Conclusion:
This work resulted in a dataset of 200 exhaustive annotated {WSIs} of normal and abnormal tissue from the colon and skin, and it has informed plans to build a comprehensive library of annotated {WSIs}. {SNOMED} {CT} was found to be the best ontology for annotation labeling. This project also demonstrates the need for future development of annotation tools in order to make the annotation process more efficient.},

            Digital histopathological images, high‐resolution images of stained tissue samples, are a vital tool for clinicians to diagnose and stage cancers. The visual analysis of patient state based on these images are an important part of oncology workflow. Although pathology workflows have historically been conducted in laboratories under a microscope, the increasing digitization of histopathological images has led to their analysis on computers in the clinic. The last decade has seen the emergence of machine learning, and deep learning in particular, a powerful set of tools for the analysis of histopathological images. Machine learning models trained on large datasets of digitized histopathology slides have resulted in automated models for prediction and stratification of patient risk. In this review, we provide context for the rise of such models in computational histopathology, highlight the clinical tasks they have found success in automating, discuss the various machine learning techniques that have been applied to this domain, and underscore open problems and opportunities.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Grade and histotype of ovarian carcinomas are often used as surrogates of molecular subtypes. We examined factors affecting pathologists' reproducibility in two prospective studies.
{METHODS}: Two pathologists independently reviewed slides from 459 incident ovarian cancers in the Nurses' Health Study ({NHS}) and {NHSII}. We described agreement on tumor characteristics using percent agreement and Cohen's standard kappa (κ) coefficients. We used logistic regression, with disagreement as the outcome, to evaluate the contribution of case and tumor characteristics to agreement.
{RESULTS}: Inter-rater agreement was 95\% (κ = 0.81) for carcinoma versus borderline, 89\% (κ = 0.58) for grade and 85\% (κ = 0.71) for histotype. Inter-rater grading disagreement was higher for non-serous histotypes ({OR} = 4.66, 95\% {CI} 2.09-10.36) and lower for cancers with bizarre atypia ({OR} = 0.13, 95\% {CI} 0.04-0.38). Agreement with original pathology reports was 94\% (κ = 0.73) for carcinoma versus borderline, 78\% (κ = 0.60) for histotype, and 79\% (κ = 0.24) for grade. Grading disagreement was significantly lower for tumors with 'solid, pseudoendometrioid or transitional' ({SET}) architecture ({OR} = 0.08, 95\%{CI} 0.01-0.84). Date of original diagnosis, hospital type, number of slides available for review, tumor stage, and slide quality were not related to agreement.
{CONCLUSION}: Overall, inter-rater agreement for tumor type and grade for archival tissue specimens was good. Agreement between the consensus review and original pathology reports was lower. Factors contributing to grading disagreement included non-serous histotype, absence of bizarre atypia, and absence of {SET} architecture.},

	abstract = {Diagnosis based on histopathology for skin cancer detection is today's gold standard and relies on the presence or absence of biomarkers and cellular atypia. However it suffers drawbacks: it requires a strong expertise and is time-consuming. Moreover the notion of atypia or dysplasia of the visible cells used for diagnosis is very subjective, with poor inter-rater agreement reported in the literature. Lastly, histology requires a biopsy which is an invasive procedure and only captures a small sample of the lesion, which is insufficient in the context of large fields of cancerization. Here we demonstrate that the notion of cellular atypia can be objectively defined and quantified with a non-invasive in-vivo approach in three dimensions (3D). A Deep Learning ({DL}) algorithm is trained to segment keratinocyte ({KC}) nuclei from Line-field Confocal Optical Coherence Tomography ({LC}-{OCT}) 3D images. Based on these segmentations, a series of quantitative, reproducible and biologically relevant metrics is derived to describe {KC} nuclei individually. We show that, using those metrics, simple and more complex definitions of atypia can be derived to discriminate between healthy and pathological skins, achieving Area Under the {ROC} Curve ({AUC}) scores superior than 0.965, largely outperforming medical experts on the same task with an {AUC} of 0.766. All together, our approach and findings open the door to a precise quantitative monitoring of skin lesions and treatments, offering a promising non-invasive tool for clinical studies to demonstrate the effects of a treatment and for clinicians to assess the severity of a lesion and follow the evolution of pre-cancerous lesions over time.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The Prostate Imaging for Recurrence Reporting ({PI}-{RR}) system was recently proposed to assess the local recurrence of prostate cancer ({PCa}), but its exact performance for the prostate after radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy is difficult to determine. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance and interreader agreement of this system using whole-mount histology of the prostate after androgen deprivation therapy ({ADT}) as the standard of reference.
{METHODS}: In total, 119 patients with {PCa} post-{ADT} underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-{MRI}) before prostatectomy. Three radiologists analyzed the {MRI} images independently, scoring imaging findings according to {PI}-{RR}. Spearman correlation was performed to assess the relationship between the percentage of sectors with residual cancer and {PI}-{RR} score. The diagnostic performance for detection of residual cancer was assessed on a per-sector basis. The chi-squared test was used to compare the cancer detection rate ({CDR}) among readers. Overall and pairwise interreader agreement in assigning {PI}-{RR} categories and residual cancer sectors with a score ≥3 or ≥4 were evaluated with the Cohen kappa coefficient.
{RESULTS}: Histology revealed 209 sectors with residual cancer. The percentage of pathologically positive sectors increased with the increase in {PI}-{RR} score for all readers. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value ({PPV}), and negative predictive value ({NPV}) at a cutoff of score 3 ranged from 74.2\% to 83.7\%, 86.4\% to 92.7\%, 51.3\% to 64.3\%, and 95.4\% to 96.9\%, respectively, and at a cutoff of score 4, they ranged from 47.4\% to 56.5\%, 97.9\% to 98.6\%, 82.5\% to 85.3\%, and 91.6\% to 92.9\%, respectively. There was no significant difference among the {CDR} of readers. In {PI}-{RR} categories and detection of residual cancer sectors, overall interreader agreement was moderate for all readers, but agreement was higher between the more experienced readers (moderate to substantial) than between the more and less experienced readers (fair to moderate).
{CONCLUSIONS}: {MRI} scoring with the {PI}-{RR} assessment provided accurate evaluation of {PCa} after {ADT}, but readers' experience influenced interreader agreement and cancer diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Reliable, reproducible methods to interpret programmed death ligand-1 ({PD}-L1) expression on tumor cells ({TC}) and immune cells ({IC}) are needed for pathologists to inform decisions associated with checkpoint inhibitor therapies. Our international study compared interpathologist agreement of {PD}-L1 expression using the combined positive score ({CPS}) under standardized conditions on samples from patients with gastric/gastroesophageal junction/esophageal adenocarcinoma. Tissue sections from 100 adenocarcinoma pretreatment biopsies were stained in a single laboratory using the {PD}-L1 immunohistochemistry 28-8 and 22C3 (Agilent) {pharmDx} immunohistochemical assays. {PD}-L1 {CPS} was evaluated by 12 pathologists on scanned whole slide images of these biopsies before and after a 2-hour {CPS} training session by Agilent. Additionally, pathologists determined {PD}-L1-positive {TC}, {IC}, and total viable {TC} on a single tissue fragment from 35 of 100 biopsy samples. Scoring agreement among pathologists was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC}). Interobserver variability for {CPS} for 100 biopsies was high, with only fair agreement among pathologists both pre- (range, 0.45-0.55) and posttraining (range, 0.56-0.57) for both assays. For the 35 single biopsy samples, poor/fair agreement was also observed for the total number of viable {TC} ({ICC}, 0.09), number of {PD}-L1-positive {IC} ({ICC}, 0.19), number of {PD}-L1-positive {TC} ({ICC}, 0.54), and calculated {CPS} ({ICC}, 0.14), whereas calculated {TC} score (positive {TC}/total {TC}) showed excellent agreement ({ICC}, 0.82). Retrospective histologic review of samples with the poorest interpathologist agreement revealed the following as possible confounding factors: (1) ambiguous identification of positively staining stromal cells, (2) faint or variable intensity of staining, (3) difficulty in distinguishing membranous from cytoplasmic tumor staining, and (4) cautery and crush artifacts. These results emphasize the need for objective techniques to standardize the interpretation of {PD}-L1 expression when using the {CPS} methodology on gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer biopsies to accurately identify patients most likely to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.},

In this paper, we present our work on developing the Pathology Image Database System ({PIDB}), which is a standard oriented image database to support retrieval of images, tiles, regions and analytical results, image visualization and experiment management through a unified interface and architecture. The system is deployed for managing and querying whole slide images for In Silico brain tumor studies at Emory University. {PIDB} is generic and open source, and can be easily used to support other biomedical research projects.

	abstract = {Questions of reproducibility and efficacy of histologic malignancy grading relative to alternative proliferation index measurements for outcome prediction remain unanswered. Microsections of specimens from the Cooperative Breast Cancer Tissue Resource ({CBCTR}) were evaluated by seven pathologists for reproducibility of grade and classification. Nuclear figure classification was assessed using photographs. Grade was assigned by the Bloom-Richardson method, Nottingham modification. Proliferation index was evaluated prospectively by deoxyribose nucleic acid precursor uptake with thymidine (autoradiographic) or bromodeoxyuridine (immunohistochemical) labeling index using fresh tissue from 631 node-negative breast cancer patients accessioned at St Luke's Hospital. A modified Nottingham-Bloom-Richardson grade was derived from histopathologic data. Median post-treatment observation was 6.4 years. Agreement on classification of nuclear figures (N=43) was less than good by kappa statistic (kappa=0.38). Grade was moderately reproducible in four trials (N=10,10,19, 10) with {CBCTR} specimens (kappa=0.50-0.59). Of components of Bloom-Richardson grade, agreement was least for nuclear pleomorphism (kappa=0.37-0.50), best for tubularity (kappa=0.57-0.83), and intermediate for mitotic count (kappa=0.45-0.64). Bloom-Richardson grade was a univariate predictor of prognosis in node-negative St Luke's patients, and was improved when mitotic count was replaced by labeling index (low, mid, or high). When labeling index was added to a multivariate model containing tumor size and vessel invasion, grade was no longer a significant predictor of tumor-specific relapse-free or overall survival. Mitotic index predicted best when intervals were lowered to 0-2, 3-10, and {\textgreater}10 mitotic figures per ten 0.18 mm(2) high-power fields. We conclude that Nottingham-Bloom-Richardson grades remain only modestly reproducible. Prognostically useful components of grade are mitotic index and tubularity. The Nottingham-Bloom-Richardson system can be improved by lowering cutoffs for mitotic index and by counting 20-30 rather than 10 high-power fields. Measurement of proliferation index by immunohistochemically detectable markers will probably give superior prognostic results in comparison to grade.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary
Gleason grading of prostate cancer is essential for treatment strategies and patient prognosis. Previous studies showed grading variation between pathologists when grading prostate cancer. Our study analyzed the presence and extent of grading variation between and within pathology laboratories in The Netherlands. In our nationwide retrospective study, we analyzed prostate needle biopsy reports of 35,258 patients in The Netherlands graded by 40 pathology laboratories. We found a considerable variation between and within pathology laboratories, as over half of the laboratories graded significantly different from the national mean. This likely affects treatment strategy and prognosis assessment of prostate cancer patients.

Abstract
Purpose: Our aim was to analyze grading variation between pathology laboratories and between pathologists within individual laboratories using nationwide real-life data. Methods: We retrieved synoptic (n = 13,397) and narrative (n = 29,377) needle biopsy reports from the Dutch Pathology Registry and prostate-specific antigen values from The Netherlands Cancer Registration for prostate cancer patients diagnosed between January 2017 and December 2019. We determined laboratory-specific proportions per histologic grade and unadjusted odds ratios ({ORs}) for International Society of Urological Pathologists Grades 1 vs. 2–5 for 40 laboratories due to treatment implications for higher grades. Pathologist-specific proportions were determined for 21 laboratories that consented to this part of analysis. The synoptic reports of 21 laboratories were used for analysis of case-mix correction for {PSA}, age, year of diagnosis, number of biopsies and positive cores. Results: A total of 38,321 reports of 35,258 patients were included. Grade 1 ranged between 19.7\% and 44.3\% per laboratory (national mean = 34.1\%). Out of 40 laboratories, 22 (55\%) reported a significantly deviant {OR}, ranging from 0.48 (95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.39–0.59) to 1.54 ({CI} 1.22–1.93). Case-mix correction was performed for 10,294 reports, altering the status of 3/21 (14\%) laboratories, but increasing the observed variation (20.8\% vs. 17.7\%). Within 15/21 (71\%) of laboratories, significant inter-pathologist variation existed. Conclusion: Substantial variation in prostate cancer grading was observed between and within Dutch pathology laboratories. Case-mix correction did not explain the variation. Better standardization of prostate cancer grading is warranted to optimize and harmonize treatment.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The aims of this study were to evaluate the reproducibility of the Gleason grading system and to compare its interobserver variability with the novel Gleason grade grouping proposal using a large sample volume.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: In total, 407 pathology slides of prostate needle biopsies from 34 consecutive patients with prostate cancer were re-evaluated. The International Society of Urological Pathology 2005 modified Gleason grading system with Epstein's modification was used. Two pathologists, blind to each other and to the initial pathology report, performed the pathological evaluation. To determine interobserver concordance, the kappa (κ) coefficient test was used.
{RESULTS}: Pathologist 1 and pathologist 2 detected a tumor in 202 and 231 cores, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). The two pathologists disagreed on the presence of a tumor in 31 cores. Of these 31 cores, 74\% (n = 23/31) were Gleason pattern 3. The mean length of the cancer foci in these 31 disputed cores was 1.54 ± 0.8 mm. Concordance rates between the two observers for primary and secondary Gleason patterns were 63.96\% (κ = 0.34) and 63.45\% (κ = 0.37), respectively. Concordance with respect to the Gleason sum was 57.9\% (κ = 0.43). When the Gleason scores were classified into the novel Gleason grade grouping, concordance was found to be 51.7\% (κ = 0.39).
{CONCLUSIONS}: The agreement between observers on the Gleason sum was moderate. The novel Gleason grade grouping did not improve interobserver agreement. Further studies are needed to confirm these results on interobserver variability.},

	abstract = {Only a few large studies of interobserver reproducibility of Gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma exist. Thirty-eight biopsies containing prostate cancer were distributed for Gleason grading to 41 general pathologists in Georgia. These cases had "consensus" Gleason grade groups (2-4, 5-6, 7, and 8-10) that were agreed on by at least 7 of 10 urologic pathologists. The overall kappa (kappa) coefficient for interobserver agreement for these 38 cases was 0.435, barely moderate agreement, with a kappa range from 0.00 to 0.88. There was consistent undergrading of Gleason scores 5-6 (47\%), 7 (47\%) and, to a lesser extent, 8-10 (25\%). In cases with consensus primary patterns, there was consistent undergrading of patterns 2 (32\%), 3 (39\%), and 5 (30\%). Pattern 2 was often (17\%) mistaken for pattern 3. Pattern 4 was often undergraded (21\%) and also mistaken for pattern 5 (17\%). The most significant (P {\textless} .005) demographic factor associated with better interobserver agreement was having learned Gleason grading at a meeting or course. We believe that Gleason grading can be learned to a satisfactory level of interobserver reproducibility and have undertaken additional studies that support this belief.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Emerging data suggest that ovarian cancers differ by tumor grade. However, the reliability of microscopic grade from paraffin tissue in the general medical community and as reflected in population-based cancer registries is unknown.
{METHODS}: We examined grade agreement between two gynecologic pathologists and the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Residual Tissue Repository ({SEER}). Grade agreement was assessed with percent observer agreement and kappa coefficients for 664 invasive ovarian carcinomas, using previously defined three-tier and two-tier grading systems. A random subset of ovarian carcinomas was selected to compare intra- and inter-pathologist agreement.
{RESULTS}: Five hundred and eighty-six of {SEER}'s 664 tumors were confirmed invasive. Percent agreement was 49 \% with fair kappa coefficient = 0.25 (95 \% {CI}: 0.20-0.30) for the 664 tumors. Agreement improved slightly when restricted to the 586 confirmed invasive cancers; it was better for high grade than low grade tumors, for two-tier than three-tier grading systems, and within (66 \%) than between study pathologists (43 \%). Grade was not a robust independent predictor of ovarian cancer-specific survival.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Grade agreement was fair between {SEER} and study pathologists irrespective of grading system. Recorded grade in {SEER} should be used with caution and is probably not a reliable metric for ovarian cancer epidemiology.},
